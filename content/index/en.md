I'm Jonko, a ROM hacker and YouTuber!

My primary work is with the [Haroohie Translation Club](https://haroohie.club), where I serve as project lead and main ROM hacker.

You may also know me from my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@jonko0493) or my [blogs](https://haroohie.club/author/jonko) where I explain how ROM hacking works.

I also dabble with homebrew and emulator development.
