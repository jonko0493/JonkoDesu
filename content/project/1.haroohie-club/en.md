The Haroohie Translation Club is a group of passionate individuals dedicated to translating the Haruhi Suzumiya video games into various languages. I serve as the project lead and chief ROM hacker for the group.

Currently, we are translating [Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu](https://haroohie.club/chokuretsu) (The Series of Haruhi Suzumiya) into English, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Arabic. We are also supporting [Qi Busiyi Hanhuazu (七不思议汉化组)](https://7.xzonn.top/) in translating the game into Chinese. We also have the translation of Suzumiya Haruhi no Heiretsu (The Parallel of Haruhi Suzumiya) in flight and are in the planning/investigation stages of the other games.

## Reverse-Engineering Work

As part of my work, I have spent a considerable amount of time reverse-engineering these games. I have documented my findings on the wikis for each of the game's utilities:
* [Suzumiya Haruhi no Chokuretsu](https://github.com/haroohie-club/ChokuretsuTranslationUtility/wiki/)
* [Suzumiya Haruhi no Heiretsu](https://github.com/haroohie-club/HeiretsuTranslationUtility/wiki/)
